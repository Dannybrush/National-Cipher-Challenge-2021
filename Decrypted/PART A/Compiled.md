## **1a} Kicking my Heels**

HARRY, I AM BORED, AND I AM REALLY NOT SURE WHY I HAVE BEEN EXILED TO THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS. DID I DO SOMETHING TO UPSET SOMEONE? I AM REALLY, REALLY HOPING THAT OUR OVERLORDS WILL FIND 
SOMETHING A BIT MORE RELEVANT FOR ME TO TACKLE SOON. THE GROUP HERE IS GREAT, BUT IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS A DIMINISHING RETURN ON BREAKING WWII CIPHERS SEVENTY-SIX YEARS ON, 
AND EVEN THE COLD WAR FIALKA INTERCEPT PILE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GIVING MUCH BACK. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR ME TO WORK ON, 
THEN MAYBE YOU COULD SEND OVER SOME NEWBIES FOR ME TO TRAIN UP? WE RECEIVED A STACK OF MATERIAL FROM LONDON A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT MIGHT MAKE A GOOD EXERCISE FOR THEM, 
AND WHILE THE FIRST FEW TEXTS ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE, IT WOULD BE A GOOD EXERCISE FOR YOUNG ANALYSTS TO TRY TO WORK OUT WHAT THEY ARE TELLING US. 
I HAVE ATTACHED THE FIRST ITEM FROM THE BATCH SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN. I WOULD VERY DEARLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT "THE GREAT MATTER" REFERS TO, 
AND I SUSPECT YOU WILL WANT TO KNOW TOO. THE RECRUITS DON'T NEED TO KNOW MUCH TO BREAK THIS ONE; IF THEY HAVE DONE OUR INDUCTION TRAINING ON BASIC CIPHERS, 
THEY SHOULD BE FINE. MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE NICKNAMED THIS FILE THE LIGHTHOUSE CONSPIRACY, BECAUSE OF WHERE THE PAPERS WERE FOUND. 
THAT MAKES IT SOUND A LOT MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN IT FIRST LOOKS, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT LEAD. I HAVE SET UP A SECURE ONLINE SYSTEM SO THE 
TRAINEES CAN GET ACCESS TO CASE FILES AND SEND ME THEIR ATTEMPTS AT DECIPHERING. IF YOU POINT THEM THERE, THEN I WILL CHECK HOW THEY ARE GETTING ON. 
MAYBE THEY COULD LOOK AT THE BOSS CODEBREAKING GUIDE AS WELL IF THEY NEED TO BRUSH UP THEIR SKILLS. ALL THE BEST, JODIE


## **2a} Don't Give Up**

Jodie, you were not placed with the Archaeologists as a punishment; everyone takes their turn on that shift because we never know what might turn up in old documents. 
When I ran the group, we found evidence of a Russian agent placed in the SDECE in the aftermath of the war who was acting as liaison with British and US intelligence. 
She had remained undiscovered for thirty-five years and leaked a whole load of information across the iron curtain. The team cracked a Fialka cipher from 1956, 
and that led to an arrest and confession. I admit that the case you are working on doesn’t seem likely to have the same impact, but you never know where it might lead. 
I took a look at the papers you sent, and I thought this one looked very interesting. The information it contains ties down the year it was written pretty conclusively, 
and I have to say I don’t like the sound of the phrase “profit from the Schleswig conflict”.
I think it is clear who M must be, but I am still unsure about the others mentioned in these letters. I am also very unclear why M might have been involved in what looks like 
a conspiracy aimed at wartime profiteering. I checked, and there is nothing on file from the period to suggest that this was suspected. Indeed there was nothing on file at all, 
which, thinking about it is slightly strange. M was a public figure and of definite interest, so there should be something. If you have time it might be worth logging in to 
the records system to see if anyone else from around then has a suspiciously empty file. I would start with public figures who have the initials CH or FN, 
as the single letters A, T, E and W don’t give us much to go on.
Of course, we do know a little more about W, so that might also be a good place to start. We know we are looking for an engineer with initial W, 
who knows something about codes and ciphers. Whoever FN is, they are right that they should talk to W. Using Caesar and affine shift ciphers to encode their secret communications is poor, 
and I would have expected better from an organisation containing M. Perhaps they will have taken the mysterious W’s advice and will have switched to something more secure in their future 
communications. That will make life a little more interesting for you and the team.
Good luck,
Harry


## **3a} Double Trouble?**

Harry, thanks for your email, I forgot you had spent time here in the Archaeologists and it was good to be reminded that it can lead somewhere. 
In this case I think the best we can hope for is that we will have a new bunch of recruits trained and ready to tackle more serious challenges, 
but I have to admit that I am getting more excited about this case, even if it is just a training exercise. The attached memo from ABC reinforces what we learned from the last one. 
The Lighthouse Conspiracy seems to be a group of influential Victorians who are aiming to use their newfound technological prowess to profit from war, famine, pestilence, 
and any other disturbance in the Force. I don’t like to jump to conclusions, but I can’t help noticing that the initials coincide with people of interest to BOSS.  
I checked Faraday’s intelligence file and as you say, it was empty. It is hard to believe that a scientist of his eminence had escaped notice, so it seems more likely that the 
real file has either been deleted or stored somewhere more secure. Perhaps you can make enquiries? B must surely be Babbage. All the talk in the attached letter is about a 
device that sounds like a computer, and that would mean that AL is Ada Lovelace, who died some years before this letter was written. I can’t be sure who W or N are, but my guess 
is that this N is the same person as FN in the previous letter. As for ABC, I have a guess, but it all seems rather fantastical. AL and B appear in some of the earliest BOSS files, 
and I always assumed they were on the side of the angels. Could they have been double agents working for BOSS inside the conspiracy? Given that it is their work that seems to be 
driving it on, it seems more likely that the reverse is true. But that means BOSS was riddled with domestic insurgents from the start. I don’t think this has the same urgency as your 
discovery of Soviet agents at the heart of British intelligence, but it is still rather alarming. As is the increasing sophistication of our protagonists’ communications. 
They are still only relying on substitution ciphers, but their head of security, W, is clearly smart enough to know that this is too weak for serious use, 
and I suspect that future letters will be protected by something more professional. I wonder if he will push them to think about using polyalphabetic ciphers, 
or if he will just introduce simple changes like blocking the ciphertext. I think it might pay for me to make a trip to London to carry out some enquiries, 
so I may be off grid for a couple of weeks. Let me know if you hear anything useful. All the best, Jodie.


## **4a} The Vault**

Harry, I am back. I spent most of the last two weeks in The Vault trying to unpack some of the mystery surrounding the lighthouse conspiracy crew and I think I made some progress. 
While I was away, the trainees tackled the letter from ABC, and they did a great job. They are shaping up well, I think we will be glad of their help as this case progresses. 
The Librarian at The Vault was very helpful and when I told her what I was looking for she pointed me to an archive of Victorian papers concerning scientists, engineers and social reformers 
that had recorded early background investigations into “People of Interest”. I say people, but I did notice that there was a heavy bias to investigating women back then. 
I was surprised at first, I had assumed that they would have been largely ignored, but I suppose these remarkable women made their presence known, and perhaps the establishment 
felt threatened. In most cases there are no standard security files for these women, but where there were, they were at best thin. The really interesting material was in the hidden archive 
where I found reports and papers about Lovelace, Nightingale and ABC. As establishment figures themselves, they seem to have been ignored by the Secret Service, 
and clearly not considered a security threat, but our BOSS forebears did carry out investigations into their activities and there are clear signs that they may have worked together. 
Obviously the fact that they were making such an impact on society was enough to make some people nervous. After all, it was a time of great change, and concerns about revolution 
were very real. One of the notes on file suggests that the growing campaign for women’s suffrage and social activism might have been the start of an insurrection, and it named several 
of our protagonists, but it didn’t say how they might have intended to trigger the uprising. What we have seen so far is that whatever the Lighthouse Conspiracy were up to they went to 
extraordinary lengths to keep it secret, and the fact that we are only now uncovering it suggests that it was much subtler than a planned uprising. I am still struggling with the idea that 
people who were part of the birth of BOSS could have been acting secretly against us, but that is certainly implied by some of the files we have cracked, and the attached document has 
added to my worries. It was written in the aftermath of the Hindenburg disaster, by someone I think you knew well. She had a fantastic record working deep undercover and reporting back to 
western intelligence agencies, but the thing that caught my eye was that here she used the codename AUGUSTA. I don’t know if you already spotted it, but the lettering around the edge of the 
lighthouse stamp reads AD AAD DDA AAD AAA D AD and substituting the A and D for dot and dash spells out her codename. I thought at first that I might be reading too much into it. 
The letter in her file seems never to have been broken. Someone wrote “double encrypted?” on the envelope and I guess that was enough to dissuade the agencies from spending much time on it. 
With hindsight, it is pretty obvious that actually it has just been encrypted once and then encoded as Morse code using the same convention A equals dot, D equals dash. 
Once that had been untangled I found it pretty easy to break, and I am very worried about what I found. I think you need to take a look. Jodie


## **5a} Derailed** 

Jodie i can see why you are concerned but i find it hard to believe that agatha could have been part of a conspiracy she was a faithful colleague in all the time i worked with her and no one 
ever suggested otherwise of course we ran the usual spot checks from time to time but nothing unusual was found having said that the message you found in the archive is really worrying my 
first thought was that she might have been acting as a double agent trying to destabilise nazi intelligence but that doesnt fit with the text it is crucial to our mission that we maintain 
the balance of uncertainty and direct it to our advantage make it look like she had definitely had another agenda i trawled through my own records to see if anyone else agatha and i worked with 
might have been involved i hate to say it but the only person of interest at the moment is charlie we worked together on the kohinoor twins case and agatha was her great aunt not that treachery 
is a genetic trait but in vetting circles it can be treated like it is inherited so i suppose we ought to take that seriously especially since she became pretty senior in american intelligence 
i checked our current case files and although she is retired she still acts as government liaison she is in london at the moment in the new embassy building which will make it difficult to get 
hold of her if she wants to stay hidden we cant afford to upset our us cousins and if we are wrong about her we might also poison the well when it comes to intelligence exchange they havent forgiven 
us for philby and maclean yet so i can imagine how they would react if it turns out that one of our own is a double agent and has infiltrated their inner sanctum i sent one of the elves to take a look 
at her apartment in new jersey it was pretty clean as you can imagine but they were able to lift the following extract it was hard to read and even harder to decipher since she used a vigenere encryption 
but one incriminating feature stands out even without a decrypt she used the ad morse encoding on top of the vigenere cipher i am not sure what we should do next could you get the team to take a look at 
the file maybe this is all a big coincidence or a misunderstanding if not then we may have to tell london and washington and i am really not looking forward to that all the best harry


## **6a} Two Clues**

Harry, I am sure this must be very hard for you as I know that Charlie was a good friend, but we can’t let that cloud our judgement. Given the content of her letter last week we have to assume she 
is involved somehow, and work on that basis. Having said that, Charlie doesn’t actually say anything that proves that she is a member of the Lighthouse Conspiracy. Of course, she is an experienced 
agent, so that might be deliberate, but she does refer to the Trinity group and it’s possible that the Americans were already investigating the conspiracy under that code name. Everything in the 
email takes on a slightly different meaning if we view it that way, but that raises the question of why they didn’t share the intelligence with us. In the meantime, I tried to track back through 
Agatha’s record to see if there is anything to suggest that she might have been a double agent. Nothing mentioned in the file raised a flag, but I noticed two things in the attached vetting 
summary: After her initial run in with the German treasure hunters seeking the Babylon stone she went on the run, and papers reported that she was a passenger on the Titanic. As you know, 
she never boarded, and used that tragedy as a way to disappear. According to the report she did not reappear for over fourteen months, when she was recruited as an intelligence source in 
Cairo for the British Embassy. That raises the question of what she was doing for the year. The other thing that struck a chord was the mention of Massourie. George Everest built a retreat 
there, and his name came up when I was researching the security files of Charles Babbage. It seems that Babbage was introduced to ideas from Indian mathematics by Everest and this influenced 
the development of the Difference Engine and its successors. Mary Boole wrote about this in her letter Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century. Given what CH wrote about 
the Difference Engine, this might be more than a coincidence, though perhaps I am reading too much into it. For the sake of our trainees, I should say that the vetting report has been double 
encrypted using a Vigenere with a second, very simple, twist; I mention it because that threw me off for a while. I suggest that they reflect on what might be going on! Given that we are now 
trying to avoid raising suspicion by the US and the Lighthouse Conspirators I think we should change our own protocols, so I have switched up to a transposition cipher. I suggest you do the 
same next time, though you could try something else like a Polybius square. Jodie


## **7a} Jodie's Diary**

WE FOUND THE ATTACHED MESSAGE HIDDEN IN THE UNDERLYING CODE OF AN IMAGE SENT IN JUNK MAIL TO PEOPLE AT THE US EMBASSY IT MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED PAST US BUT LUCKILY HARRY AND I HAD ALREADY 
FIGURED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT TRY TO COMMUNICATE THIS WAY THE CONSPIRACY HAD AVOIDED DETECTION FOR OVER A CENTURY SO THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO MAKE THE MISTAKE OF SENDING MESSAGES EXPLICITLY 
ADDRESSED TO ONE ANOTHER IT IS ALWAYS BEST NOT TO MAKE LINKS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF A NETWORK AND A WELL HIDDEN MESSAGE IN JUNKMAIL AVOIDS THAT RISK ESPECIALLY IF IT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED 
BY ONE OF THE BOTNET WORKS LIKE THIS ONE I WAS TOO FOCUSSED ON THE DECRYPT AT FIRST AND WASNT READING WHAT IT SAID UNTIL I FOUND HER NAME STARING BACK AT ME AT THE END PERHAPS WE 
SHOULD HAVE ALREADY REALISED THAT TRINITY COULD BE INVOLVED BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT HER NAME WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A COINCIDENCE THE FACT SHES CHARLIES NIECE SHOULD HAVE 
LIT UP THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD THOUGH AND I AM WORRIED THAT HARRY DIDNT RAISE IT PERHAPS HE IS ALREADY SHADOWING HER AND DIDNT LIKE TO SAY SO OUT OF LOYALTY BUT HE DIDNT TELL ME 
THAT AND SOMEHOW I THINK HE WOULD I THINK ITS MORE LIKELY THAT SHES BEYOND SUSPICION IN HIS MIND SHE HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HIS NETWORK FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND THE FACT THAT 
SHE MIGHT BE A DOUBLE AGENT WILL BE A REAL BLOW THAT WAS BAD BUT IT WASNT THE WORST OF IT THE DETAIL TRINITY GIVES ON THE CONSPIRACYS RECENT ACTIVITIES IS TRULY FRIGHTENING WHAT 
COULD THEY WANT AT THE HEART OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE GROUPS SURELY THEY CANT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUTBREAK AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING AT COPI DESPERATELY WANT TO TAKE THIS 
TO HARRY TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT BUT THE FINAL PARAGRAPH STOPPED ME IN MY TRACKS WHY ON EARTH DOES TRINITY THINK I MIGHT JOIN THEM WHAT HAVE I SAID OR DONE THAT 
WOULD MAKE THEM THINK I COULD BE A TRAITOR AND WILL THAT MAKE HARRY DISTRUST ME TOO IM NOT SURE I CAN TAKE THAT RISK I MIGHT HAVE TO FINISH THIS MISSION ALONE
