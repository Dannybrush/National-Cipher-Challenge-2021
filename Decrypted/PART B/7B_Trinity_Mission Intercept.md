CHARLIE I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO LONDON WE CAN'T RISK MEETING AND YOUR ARRIVAL HAS BEEN NOTICED BY BOSS HEIGHTENING SUSPICION HARRYS TEAM IS ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING OUR 
ORGANISATION AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT THEM OFF THE SCENT UNFORTUNATELY I'M WORKING WITH VERY CONSTRAINED RESOURCES DESPITE AL LOUR PANDEMIC PREPARATIONS IT HAS 
BEEN HARD WORK OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AS PLANNED WE USED THE CRISIS TO EMBED MORE OPERATIVES AT THE HEART OF GOVERNMENT DECISIONMAKING UNDER THE COVER OF SAGE AND THE OTHER 
NEW COMMITTEES WE NOW HAVE A NETWORK OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN WHITEHALL WITH THE DIRECT EAR OF SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND POLITICIANS THEY ALSO HELPED US TO INFILTRATE COP 
GIVING US DIRECT ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS THAT HAD REMAINED BEYOND OUR REACH WHILE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FULLY DELIVER ON OUR PLANS FOR THAT EVENT THE CONNECTIONS WE 
MADE WITH SOME OF THE WORLDS LARGEST COMPANIES AND SMALLEST STATES WILL SURELY PAYOFF IN THE MEDIUM TERM ON THE DOWNSIDE I HAVEN'T HAD THE CAPACITY I NEED TO WORK ON THE BOSS 
INVESTIGATION INTO OUR ORGANISATION THAT IS BEING RUN FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGY DIVISION HERE AT G.C.H.Q. I HAD HOPED THAT ASSIGNMENT MEANT THAT THE CASE WAS REGARDED A SLOW PRIORITY BUT 
HARRY ASSIGNED HIS BEST AGENT JODIE TOR UNIT AND GAVE HER ALMOST UNLIMITED RESOURCES SHE HA STEAMS ALL ACROSS THE UK TRAWLING THROUGH THE PAPERS WE LEFT BEHIND AT THE LIGHTHOUSE AND 
TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THEY MEAN I AM SO ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR THAT BUT I HAVE PERSONALLY CHECKED AND ALL THE MAJOR ITEMS FROM THE FOUNDATION ARCHIVE WERE SHIPPED OUT TO MASSOURIE AND 
HAVE BEEN SECURED AT THE PARK I ASSIGNED A TEAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KEY DOCUMENTS WERE PROPERLY ENCRYPTED IN CASE JODIE'S TEAM FINDS THEM BUT GIVEN THE TALENTS HE IS WORKING WITH I 
NOW THINK WE MIGHT NEED TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS AND I PLAN TO VISIT THE HQ AS SOON AS I CAN GETAWAY WHETHER OR NOT JODIE AND HER TEAM WORK OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING THE BEST WAY TO MAKE 
SURE THAT HARRY DOES NOT FIND OUT MIGHT BE TO CONVINCE HER NOT TO TELL HIM I HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT SOME BACKGROUND CHECKS AND I AM WONDERING IF WE SHOULD JUST TRY TO RECRUIT HER 
DIRECTLY IFS HE WAS WORKING WITH US THEN I'M SURE SHE WOULD SEE THE NEED FOR SECRECY THE DIRECT APPROACH IS RISKY BUT THE ORGANISATION HAS NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM THAT BEFORE OR YOU 
AND I WOULDN'T BE WORKING FOR IT I THINK IT IS A RISK WORTH TAKING YOUR LOVING NIECE TRINITY
