i think boss might suspect something they drafted the report on the lighthouse discovery over a month ago and have still not forwarded a summary to us here in the us i cant risk making enquiries through the usual channels but i think we need
to investigate i am disappointed that the trinity team left files in the basement when they shipped out but they did not have a lot of warning and at least they dont seem to have left anything current for harry to find if they had he wouldnt
have passed the investigation to the archaeologists it would have gone straight upstairs for action i am in two minds about it if anyone else was investigating i would say we should ignore it they are unlikely to make much of a historical
curiosity but if anyone could trace the link to us now then harry and jodie are the ones to do it jodie is a terrier who wont let anything go once she has her teeth into it and harry has been around long enough to know when something trivial
is actually important on balance i think i will need to be on the ground where i can hope to influence the direction of their enquiries for the good of everyone we need to keep a very low profile atleast while the boss investigation is hot 
so unless the system flags a real crisis we will have to dial down our activities for a while we will carry on with forecasts but will not act on them unless the threat level rises to ten even then the curia will need to meet to decide whether
 it is wise to take action i will head to london to take charge of misdirection you can contact me at the embassy charlie
