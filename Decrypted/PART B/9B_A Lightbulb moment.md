REPORT FROM MARY EVEREST BOOLE TO THE CURIA OF THE TRINITY FOUNDATION THIS REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE CURIA TO 
RECORD THE OUTCOME OF THE COMMISSIONING AND ACTIVITIES OF THE SOUTER POINT FACILITY AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON 
ITS DEVELOPMENT AFTER YEARS OF PIONEERING WORK BY FARADAY AND OTHERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY MACHINES 
OUT GREW THE CAPACITY IN OUR HEADQUARTERS AT TRINITY WHARF WITH EACH NEW INCREASE IN SPEED AND POWER THE RISK OF 
DISCOVERY GREW UNTIL THE CURIA HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COMMISSION A NEW FACILITY INSPIRED BY THE LESSONS LEARNED IN 
LONDON IT WAS DECIDED TO BUILD A LARGER ESTABLISHMENT UNDERCOVER OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTER POINT LIGHTHOUSE 
THE FIRST DEDICATED ELECTRICALLY POWERED LAMP OF ITS KIND THE GROWTH IN MINING IN THE AREA PROVIDED EXCELLENT COVER 
FOR THE INSTALLATION OF OUR NETWORK OF CAVERNS UNDERNEATH THE LIGHTHOUSE AND THE INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF 
THE LIGHTHOUSE LAMPS TEAM ENGINES PUMPS AND GENERATORS DISGUISED OUR OWN ACTIVITIES AS WE EQUIPPED THE BASE THE 
HOLMES GENERATORS THAT WE PROCURED ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE SELECTED FOR THE LIGHTHOUSE SO THAT SPARE PARTS CAN BE 
PROCURED EASILY WITHOUT RAISING SUSPICION THEY ARE DRIVEN BY A PAIR OF STEAM ENGINES LOCATED DEEP IN THE ROCK OF 
C LEAD ON HILL BENEATH THE LIGHTHOUSE ENGINE ROOM MUCH OF THE NOISE AND HEAT THEY PRODUCE IS MUFFLED BY THE ROCKS 
AND THAT WHICH ESCAPES IS MISTAKEN BY NEIGHBOURS FOR THE CHURNING OF THE LIGHTHOUSE MACHINERY IT SEEMS THAT NO 
SUSPICIONS HAVE BEEN AROUSED AMONG THE LOCALS WHO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SOMEHOW RELATED TO 
THE LIGHTHOUSE AND THE MINES IT IS A WONDER TO BEHOLD THE HEAVY MACHINERY CONVERTING THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSIVE 
FLYWHEEL IN TO THE IMPERCEPTIBLE MOTION OF MYSTERIOUS ELECTRICAL CHARGES THROUGH THE WIRES IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
COMPREHEND THAT THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE MACHINE CAN COMBINE TO PRODUCE ANYTHING APPROACHING HUMAN THOUGHT AND YET 
IT COMPUTES MOREOVER THIS COMPUTER EMBODIES THE VISION OF THE COUNTESS OF LOVELACE THAT OF A MACHINE WHICH CAN GO 
BEYOND ME RECALCULATION TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE VAST SCREEDS OF INFORMATION THAT NOW CROSS THE WORLD BY THE MIRACLE 
OF TELEGRAPHY OUR STAFF AT SOUTER POINT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE ADDITIONAL ENERGY PROVIDED BY THE NEW 
GENERATORS TO DOUBLET HE COMPUTING POWER OF THE ANALYTICAL ENGINE AND ARE NOW ABLE TO PROCESS TWICE AS MANY 
TELEGRAMS IN THE SAME TIME USING THE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES PIONEERED BY BABBAGE AND NIGHTINGALE AND AIDED BY THE 
POWER OF THE DEVICE THE MOST SECURELY ENCIPHERED MESSAGES YIELD THEIR SECRETS PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE BEYOND 
ANYTHING THAT COULD BE ASCERTAINED BY EVEN THE LARGEST NETWORK OF AGENTS WHILE THIS MUCH IS GOOD AND TO BE 
CELEBRATED THERE IS ALSO BAD NEWS I AM DISAPPOINTED TO REPORT THAT THE ADDITIONAL VOLUME OF TRAFFIC ON THE 
TELEGRAPHY NETWORK AND THE INCREASED RATE AT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER THOSE MESSAGES HAS STRETCHED THE 
ABILITY OF OUR MOST POWERFUL ENGINE THE FOUNDATION MACHINE TO SUPPORT THE ANALYSTS IN THEIR WORK AS A RESULT WE 
RISK DROWNING IN INFORMATION WE CANNOT USE WE HAVE REACHED THE LIMITS OF WHAT ONE MACHINE CAN DO AND IF WE ARE TO 
MAKE THE MOST OF THIS NEW BOUNTY THEN WE WILL NEED TO LINK SEVERAL IN THEIR COMPUTATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN ANALYSE 
AND REPORT WHAT THEY FIND AS FAST AS THE MESSAGES FLOW THIS WILL REQUIRE AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN OUR PRODUCTION OF 
ELECTRICITY WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY COMBUSTION WITHOUT A LARGE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL THE COST 
WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE BUT EVEN IF IT COULD BE MET THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAT AND NOISE 
WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO ESCAPE ATTENTION EVEN ON THE WILD NORTHEAST COAST IF WE ARE TO REALISE OUR FULL AMBITIONS WE 
NEED TO FIND A MORE REMOTE LOCATION WITH A READY SOURCE OF POWERED I SONS WORK AT APPLETONS HOWS GREAT PROMISE AND 
I THINK I KNOW THE IDEAL LOCATION TO BUILD IT MARY EVEREST BOOLE
